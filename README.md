## Overview

This project, undertaken as the final project for the *Machine Learning Essentials* lecture at the University of Heidelberg, focuses on the **design, implementation, and training of intelligent AI agents to play Bomberman**.  We leveraged Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to create agents capable of strategic gameplay in this classic environment.  The goal was to develop agents that could strategically place bombs, collect power-ups, navigate the maze, and ultimately outmaneuver opponents to be the last player standing.

This repository showcases our exploration of various RL algorithms and neural network architectures applied to the challenging and dynamic environment of Bomberman.  We successfully implemented and compared three distinct agent types:

*   **Q-Learning Agent:** A foundational RL agent using a tabular Q-value function.
*   **Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent:**  A state-of-the-art agent utilizing deep neural networks for Q-value approximation and experience replay for enhanced learning.
*   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Agent:**  An advanced agent employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to process sequential game states and capture temporal dependencies, allowing for more nuanced strategic decision-making.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of Reinforcement Learning principles, deep learning architectures, and practical application to a complex game environment.
